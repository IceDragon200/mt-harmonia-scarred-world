# Item Groups

HSW tries to make use of some conventions for group names:

* `tc_*` groups prefixed with `tc_` are tool classes (e.g. `tc_axe`)
* `mat_*` groups prefixed with `mat_` are material classes (e.g. `mat_iron`)
* `wb_tool` is a group that marks workbench tools, its value can be anything greater than 0
