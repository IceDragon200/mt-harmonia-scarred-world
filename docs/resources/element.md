# Element

If Mana is the energy of the world, then Element is the physical counterpart, while lorewise it's also just a form of mana, Element represents a malleable yet unstable resource used to give something form.

Gameplay wise, players accumulate element slowly over time, or by breaking down other items into it.

Element can then be used to form new items where applicable.

It's most common result is WME, or Weak-Material Element, a stable but weak application of Element fabrication techniques.

## Usage

Element is a "free" resource allowing players to craft basic tools from basically nothing, however those tools are extremely fragile and when broken are similarly reduced to nothing.

Element can be used to fabricate everyday items from nothing, however it requires a great deal of energy and effectively resources.
