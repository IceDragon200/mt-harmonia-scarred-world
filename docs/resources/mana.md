# Mana

The lifeblood of the world, the gift of the abyss.

It can be considered the blood of all life and the primary resource of magic.

Mana exists within the world and is abundant.

## Function

Mana is a free and renewable energy, there is only one catch, mana has a tendency to corrupt everything it touches when the block it is in is saturated to the max.
