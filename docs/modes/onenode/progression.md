# One-Node Progression

* Players spawn atop the `CORE` node
  * Punching it produces three primary materials:
    * BODY
    * SPIRIT
    * ETHEREAL
  * The three resources correspond to the Syniso three-body concept, the spirit is bound to the body via the ethereal, otherwise all returns to the abyss.
* Using 9 BODY materials, players will craft a `FORM I` node which acts as a platform but also the preliminary material to create the ABYSS Workbench
