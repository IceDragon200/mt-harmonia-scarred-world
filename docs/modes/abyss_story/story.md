# Abyss Story

The Abyss Storyline can be seen as a sequel to the Surface Story, but would be more focused on harder gameplay think more complicated builds, material requirements and digging deeper into machine puzzles (think DATA and computer related tricks).

## Lore Timeline

The Abyss story takes place in a "fracture" timeline.

If you have no idea what that is either, well... it would take a bit to explain it or the pre-paradox, see the [Surface Story](../surface_story/story.md).

## Story

The player awakens in the familiar tower from the Surface Story, their memories a blur and everything distraut and reminiscent of their last visit to the abyss to meet the Ancient One.

Paths are non existent, the vastness of the abyss lays before them.

A worn sign labels the tower, "Control Tower Five", five was unusual, they had only ever known "one", what of the other three?
